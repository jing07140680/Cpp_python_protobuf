# Cpp_python_protobuf

This is a simple example of python/c++ communication example using protobuf for serialization and UNIX sockets. The server is written in C++ while the client is written in python. 

It has been tested on Ubuntu 16.04. The only (obvious) dependency, aside of UNIX socket functions, is protobuf : https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/


Python Version: 3
Protobuf Version: 3.19.x
